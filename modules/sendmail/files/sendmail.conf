# Parameter file for sendmail (sourced by /usr/share/sendmail/sendmail)
# Make all changes herein, instead of altering /etc/init.d/sendmail.
#
# After making changes here, you'll need to run /usr/sbin/sendmailconfig
# or /usr/share/sendmail/update_conf to have the changes take effect -
# If you change DAEMON_MODE, QUEUE_MODE, or QUEUE_INTERVAL, you'll also
# need to run /etc/init.d/sendmail restart.
#
# Changes made herein will be kept across upgrades - except for comments!
# Some comment lines have special significance ...
#
# **** **** **** **** DO NOT EDIT THE COMMENTS **** **** **** ****
#
# Supported parameters (and defaults) are listed herein.
#
# Notes:
#	* This setup allows sendmail to run in several modes:
#	  - listener and queue runner..DAEMON_MODE="daemon".QUEUE_MODE="daemon"
#	  - listener only..............DAEMON_MODE="daemon".QUEUE_MODE="none"
#	  - queue runner only..........DAEMON_MODE="none"...QUEUE_MODE="daemon"
#	  - *NOTHING* ?!?..............DAEMON_MODE="none"...QUEUE_MODE="none"
#
#	* You can also run the listener from inetd:
#	  - listener and queue runner..DAEMON_MODE="inetd"..QUEUE_MODE="daemon"
#	  - listener only..............DAEMON_MODE="inetd"..QUEUE_MODE="none"
#
#	* You can also run the queue runner from cron:
#	  - listener and queue runner..DAEMON_MODE="....."..QUEUE_MODE="cron"
#	  - queue runner only..........DAEMON_MODE="none"...QUEUE_MODE="cron"
#
#	* _PARMS entries herein are shown in precedence order, any later _PARMS
#	  field will, if applicable, override any previous _PARMS fields.
#
#	* Values *MUST* be surrounded with double quotes ("), single quotes
#	  will *NOT* work !

#				SMTP Listener Configuration
#
# DAEMON_NETMODE="Static";  Keyword  SMTP network mode
#	static:  Do not monitor any network interfaces for changes
#	dynamic: Monitor one or more interfaces for changes
#
DAEMON_NETMODE="Static";
#
# DAEMON_NETIF="eth0";  string SMTP interface(s)
#	This parameter defines the network interface(s) that the daemon
#	will monitor for status changes (via ppp, dhcp, ifup/down hooks).
#
# NOTES:
#	1) Only list more than one interfaces if they only used for fallback,
#	   otherwise the daemon will wind up ping-ponging between interfaces.
#	2) Do not use 'lo' unless your daemon only listens on the localhost.
#
DAEMON_NETIF="eth0";
#
# DAEMON_MODE="Daemon";  Keyword	SMTP listener
#	daemon:  Run as standalone daemon
#	inetd:	 Run from inet supervisor (forks for each mail)
#	none:	 No listener (ie, nullclient/smarthost)
#
# NOTE: If you choose "none", mail will build up in the MSP queues
#       and you will not receive any mail from external sites.

# DAEMON_HOSTSTATS="No";  Boolean	Listener stats
#	This parameter determines whether or not host stats are collected

#	sendmail delivery attempt.	The files are fixed in size, and small,
#	but there can be many of them.
#
DAEMON_HOSTSTATS="No";
#
# DAEMON_MAILSTATS="No";  Boolean	Listener stats
#	This parameter determines whether or not mailer stats are collected
#	and available for the `mailstats` command to display.  There will
#	be a (minor) performance hit, as this file will be updated for each
#	item coming into, or out of, sendmail.	The file is fixed in size,
#	and small, so there's no need to rotate it.

# NOTE: To use persistent queue-runners use this form:  p120m
#
# NOTE: If you leave this field blank, You get *NO* queue runners !!!

#				SMTP - MSP Queue Runner Configuration
#
# MSP_MODE="Cron";  Keyword  MSP queue runner mode
#	daemon:  Run as standalone daemon

#
MSP_MODE="Cron";
#
# MSP_INTERVAL="20m";  Timespec (digits+w|d|h|m|s)
#	Interval at which to run the MSP queues.  What interval should you use?
#	The amount of time that is acceptable before retrying delivery on

#	in the message submission queue.  The MTA shouldn't be down that often
#	so this can be larger than QUEUE_INTERVAL.

#				Miscellaneous Confguration
#
# MISC_PARMS="";  String  miscellaneous parameters
#	Miscellaneous parameters - applied to any sendmail invocation.
#	Any parameters here are also used when run from cron.
#	Applied after {DAEMON,QUEUE}_PARMS, and can therefore override them
#	if need be (in which case why did use them?)
#	Note that CRON_PARMS, if applicable, will override anything
#	declared herein.

#	want shared betwixt the possibly separate listener/queue-runner
#	processes.

#				Cron Job Configuration
#
# CRON_MAILTO="root";  String  cronjob output
#	Recipient of *rare* cronjob output.  Some cronjobs will be running
#	under user `mail`, so any problems encountered would probably be missed
#	so define a user who actually (hopefully) checks email now and again.
#
CRON_MAILTO="root";
#
# CRON_PARMS="";  String  cron specific parmeters
#	Cron parameters - applied *only* when sendmail queue running is done
#	via a cronjob. Applied after QUEUE_PARMS and MISC_PARMS, and can
#	therefore override them if need be.
#
CRON_PARMS="";
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#				Other stuff
# LOG_CMDS="No"; Binary	command logging flag
#	Will cause syslog entries for many of the sendmail related commands
#	like runq, mailq, etc - you'll also see cron jobs (if enabled).
#
LOG_CMDS="No";
#
# HANDS_OFF="No"; Binary  Do *NOT* touch the configuration
#	Set this *ONLY* if you are going to be fully responsible for the entire
#	setup of sendmail - the directories, permissions, databases, etc.  With
#	this variable set to "Yes", nothing will be done for you during updates.
#
#	In other words, "The blood be upon your hands" if you set this...
#	My ability to help with problems will be greatly reduced !
#
#	"Well, a pet peeve of mine is people who directly edit the
#	.cf file instead of using the m4 configuration files.
#	Don't do it! [laughs] I treat the .cf file as a binary
#	file - you should too."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#				Queue Aging Configuration
#
#	Why would you want to age your queues?	On every queue-run interval,
#	sendmail will try *every* file in the queue...	If a site is down
#	for a while, considerable time can be wasted each interval in retrying
#	it.  The scheme supported allows aging by time, and can move the older
#	files to another (less frequently run queue), thereby reducing overal
#	system impact - and providing better mail throughput.
#
#	Note that this support is completely separate from QUEUE_MODE=cron,
#	you can age queues even if you're running QUEUE_MODE=daemon.
#
#	There are four parts to the queue aging support, and these parts
#	may be repeated, to operate on multiple queues.
#
#	1. Interval at which to age the queues (in minutes).
#	   What interval should you use?  Roughly twice the normal queue
#	   interval, so that messages are tried twice in each successively
#	   slower queue.
#
#	   NOTE: some values just wont work, due to crontab pecularities
#	   a value of 90 minutes will actually be run at every x:30 !
#	   Please check /etc/cron.d/sendmail to make sure it is doing what
#	   you thought it should !
#
#	2. Criteria (optional and defaults to interval).  This is the
#	   specification of which files to move.  It defaults moving
#	   files whose age in the queues exceeds the interval.
#	   This field, if specified can be very complex - supporting
#	   aging by just about anything! see qtool(8) for details.
#
#	3. To queue.  This is the queue to which files will be moved.
#	   It may be fully qualified, or relative to /var/spool/mqueue.
#
#	4. From queue.	This is the queue from which files will be moved.
#	   It may be fully qualified, or relative to /var/spool/mqueue.
#
#	Samples:
#	AGE_DATA="[['25m', '', 'hourly', 'main']]";
#		Every 25 minutes, move any file older than 25 minutes from
#		/var/spool/mqueue/main to /var/spool/mqueue/hourly
#
#	AGE_DATA="[['25m',	'', 'hourly', 'main'],\
#		['120m', '', 'daily',  'hourly']]";
#		Same as the above, but also move files from the hourly queue
#		to the daily queue after 120 minutes in the hourly queue.
#
#	AGE_DATA="[['25m',\
#		'-e \'$msg{message}[0] == /Deferred: 452 4.2.2 Over quota/\'',\
#		'overquota', 'main']]";
#		Every 25 minutes, move all files deferred because of quota
#		violations from /var/spool/mqueue/main to
#		/var/spool/mqueue/overquota where they can be processed on
#		a different interval, or by some other means.
#
#	If the above samples suggest Perl arrays, well, they are...
#
# AGE_DATA="";  Perl array  Queue aging data
#
AGE_DATA="";
